Internship Project: Restaurant Data Analysis

During my internship, I worked on a comprehensive data analysis project focused on a dataset of restaurants. The main tasks included:

1. Cuisine Analysis: Identified the top three most common cuisines and calculated the percentage of restaurants serving these cuisines.
2. City Insights: Analyzed the cities with the highest number of restaurants and calculated the average ratings for each city. Also, determined the city with the highest average rating.
3. Price Range Distribution: Created visualizations to show the distribution of restaurant price ranges and calculated the percentage of restaurants in each range.
4. Online Delivery Analysis: Analyzed the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery and compared their ratings to restaurants without online delivery.
5. Rating Distribution: Studied the distribution of aggregate restaurant ratings and calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.
6. Cuisine Combination: Identified common cuisine combinations and determined if they had any impact on restaurant ratings.
7. Geographic Analysis: Mapped restaurant locations using latitude and longitude coordinates to identify clustering and patterns.
8. Restaurant Chains: Analyzed the presence of restaurant chains in the dataset and examined their ratings and popularity.

I used Python with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to perform the analysis and create visualizations. This project helped in enhancing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and deriving insights from real-world datasets.
